# Sloth

This is a concatenative language interpreter, written in a [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) style.  The intent is not to create a speedy language -- rather, it's a sketch of an interpreter for a pretty slow, but adorable language.  

Since the code is in the literate style, it's probably best to just open the [source code](sloth.lisp) and have at it.  It's written in Common Lisp, but hopefully not in too obtuse a style as to be difficult to read.
