# languages
Experimental projects with programming languages.

This repository is for storing little language interpreters / compilers as I learn about designing programming languages.  Each project I add to the repo will have its own README.

So far, this repo contains:

 - [Sloth](sloth/README.md) -- a simple concatenative language, written in a [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) style.
